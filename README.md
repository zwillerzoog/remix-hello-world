# Welcome to this Hello World app!

This app was bootstrapped with Remix.

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Prerequisites

Node v20.14.0 or higher

## Installation

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/zwillerzoog/remix-hello-world.git
```

```sh
cd remix-hello-world
```

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Usage

See "Hello World" in different languages by clicking the buttons.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
